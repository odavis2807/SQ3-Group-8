"""
test_acceptance_sad.py

This module contains acceptance tests for sad path scenarios of the
Flask image prediction application. The tests cover:

1. Uploading requests with missing files
2. Handling invalid or incorrect input data

Each test ensures the application gracefully handles errors and returns
appropriate responses.

def client():
    """
    Fixture for the Flask test client.
    - Purpose: Set up a test client for making requests to the Flask app during testing.
    - Usage: Provides a `client` object to use for HTTP request simulations.

def test_acceptance_missing_file(client):
    """
    Test Case: No File Uploaded
    - Purpose: Validate the application's behavior when no file is provided in the upload request.
    - Scenario:
        - Simulate a POST request to the `/prediction` route with no file data.
        - Assert the response status code is 200 (to indicate a valid request was processed).
        - Verify that the response includes an appropriate error message.

    # Simulate a POST request with no file data
    response = client.post("/prediction", data={}, content_type="multipart/form-data")

    # Assertions:
    # 1. Ensure the response status code is 200, indicating the request was processed.
    assert response.status_code == 200

    # 2. Check for a meaningful error message in the response data.
    #    Modify the message check if your application uses a different error response text.
